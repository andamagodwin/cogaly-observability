# cogaly-observability
Cogaly Observability is a healthcare-focused AI observability and safety monitoring system built for the Datadog × Google Cloud hackathon. The project demonstrates how to design end-to-end observability for an LLM-powered medical AI application, with a specific focus on early Alzheimer’s risk assessment.
